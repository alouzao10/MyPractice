Why Learn NodeJS:
   NPM is largest open sourced library system for 3rd party modules
   multiple packages to perform validation and add modules

   it is an event driven and non-blocking I/O model for communication with
   databases and other files or http requests to APIs
   when one user request items others don't get interrupted

   non-blocking allows the flow of retrieving data to not be in a waiting state
   but can execute other functions as well to fetch information and the
   application will perform much quicker
